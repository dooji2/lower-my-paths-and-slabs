# Lower My Paths and Slabs!
A Minecraft mod that lets you place blocks on top of dirt paths and slabs, by lowering the model and collision of the block.

**This mod doesn't modify anything permanently, therefore you can remove it or add it back at anytime!**

There is an Offset Tool (found in the Tools & Utilities tab) which toggles lowering per-block. Offsets are off by default except for blocks sitting directly on a dirt path or bottom slab, and you can turn them on or off by right-clicking with the Offset Tool.

Multipart blocks only offset when every part sits above a path block or bottom slab.
